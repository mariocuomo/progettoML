# Machine Learning projects
This repository is inspired by Machine Learning course at Roma Tre University.


I developed two main projects about Diabetic Retinopathy
- [Project1](https://github.com/mariocuomo/MachineLearningProjects/tree/main/project1)<br>
Creation of a Machine Learning model that can identify the presence of retinopathy diabetic - binary classification - from features extracted from images of eyes.
It is inspired from this [paper](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/comp-2020-0222/html) and the dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set).

- [Project2](https://github.com/mariocuomo/MachineLearningProjects/tree/main/project2)<br>
Rather than extracting features from the images and creating a simplified dataset, the images are directly input to the system using a convolutional neural network - VGG16.
