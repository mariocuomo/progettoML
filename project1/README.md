# Project1

Creation of a Machine Learning model that can identify the presence of retinopathy diabetic - binary classification - from features extracted from images of eyes.
It is inspired from this [paper](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/comp-2020-0222/html) and the dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set).
